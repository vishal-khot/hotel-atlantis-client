										<br />A Suite is like a subtle apartment
										inside the hotel. A Suite is much larger
										as compared to the standard room. There
										are bedrooms, living areas and even a
										kitchen. Suites are designed for use by
										merchants and families who live in
										hotels for an extended period of time.
										These rooms are much spacious with
										excellent views and exclusive amenities.
										Suites are more expensive rooms than
										standard rooms and deluxe rooms in the
										hotel. If you wish to enjoy a premium
										and luxury stay, a Suite is the way to
										go!
